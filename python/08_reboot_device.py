"""Reboot a device configuration using Cisco Business Dashboard.

Trigger a reboot for the specified device(s) using the Cisco Business
Dashboard API.  The device(s) to be rebooted are passed as command line options.
The details of the Dashboard are contained in the environment.py file.

Note that the reboot action can also be performed on networks, which result in
all devices in the network being restarted.  Given how disruptive this could
be, this option has not been implemented in this script. :)

Command line arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
                        The nodeId for the device to reboot. Multiple IDs may
                        be specified.
